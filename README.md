# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation behind completing this project is to capture as much knowledge and hands on experience as I could get out of it. Compiling notes that I feel are significant that can also potentially actually be beneficial for me or others. Having the opportunity to create this project on my own and making sure to retain as much from it as possible was my goal for this project. It not only walked me through the basics of creating a webpage and the components needed to make that happen but also gave me the chance to ensure I gathered as much relevant information that I could to list for the study guide. I feel that I have a clear basic understanding of the material and what it entails which I feel is a great preparation for the start of class. This project really stands out to me because it was all something we had to complete on our own and troubleshoot without any assistance. Overall, it was a great solo learning experience.
