      <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
       <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
       <li>The footer element which is at the bottom of the webpage, usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap and navigation.</li>
       <li>The image element contains image for the webpage. The SRC attribute defines the images location and the ALT attribute describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
       <li>The br element creates a line of empty space or a line break between two blocks on content</li>
       <li>The element that contains unordered or bulleted lists would be ul, ol, and li.</li>
       <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
       <li>The level of heading element indicates the size of the heading text like for title and subtitle with h1 being the largest and each progressing number outputting a smaller size (h2, h3, h4, h5, h6).</li>
       <li>Understanding the difference between tag vs element, as an element refers to the entire element and a tag whereas the tag is what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
       <li>Some common non-semantic elements are div which creates division in the webpage and span which creates an inline division.</li>
       <li>The body element is an example of a semantic element as the name of the element describes it's contents.</li>
       <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve the webpage to users but typically not seen and is contained in the opening head element. Some metadata tags would include: title, style, base, link, meta, and script.</li>
       <li>The head element includes nested elements that contain metadata that helps a browser render the page correctly. Some examples of this would be the document type declaration which is not case sensitive, the HTML opening tag which represents the root or start of our HTML document and also the language attribute which for English would be en.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
       <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets which is a programming language that defines how a webpage is presented to users whereas HTML strickly define the structure and content of a webpage.</li>
       <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
       <li>CSS defines style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
       <li>CSS can be styled on a webpage in three ways: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
       <li>Inline CSS styles elements directly in HTML file and applies to specific HTML tag and uses style attribution with a CSS rule. Can also be embedded using style element in head element in HTML file.</li>
       <li>An external CSS style sheet is used most commonly as making changes can be easier and is stored in a separate file.</li>
       <li>Selectors define the element or attributes to which rules or declarations apply.</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
       <li>The selector * indicates that all elements on the webpage will have the same style.</li>
       <li>The img selector assigns property values to image element.</li>
       <li>The link element is needed to link external CSS file to HTML file.</li>
       <li>CSS rule can be assigned to specified class attribute in an element which will cause them all to have the same properties.</li>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project by tracking changes made.</li>
        <li>Git commands can aid in tracking changes locally to your computer and used alongside with GitHub which makes collaborating with a team on a project much easier.</li>
        <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
        <li>Git's branching and merging capabilities enable developers to experiment with new features or bug fixes without disrupting the main code.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
        <li>JavaScript can provide your website with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</li>
        <li>JavaScript takes a HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive; for example, clicking a button, retrieving data, or filling out a form.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is case sensitive so if you have a problem in the code check the case.</li>
        <li>Keyword const is used to create variables and once declared it can never be reassigned.</li>
        <li>Assignment operator = is used to assign specific data we want stored in our variable.</li>
        <li>Must add code to link the JavaScript file to the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Can check your output by right-clicking webpage and then clicking inspect in Chrome DevTools.</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>Conditional statements and loop control define the order in which a code is executed or if it is even executed at all.</li>
        <li>Decision making can be inplemented in the code with if statements and more than one condition can be created using else if.</li>
        <li>The computer will continue through the conditions list evaluating whether condition is "truthy" or "falsey".</li>
        <li>The strict equality operator = = = checks to see if two values are equal and returns a Boolean result of true if values are equal and false if value is not equal. If no equal values are found then "Please try again" will be logged in console.</li>
        <li>An array stores a group of related data in a variable. Arrays are not limited to a single type of data. You can log all values of the array individually or as a loop which is useful when dealing with a high amount of items.</li>
        <li>Keywork let allows us to reassign the variable over time. You will always want to determine the starting point for the loop, set condition, and allow array to iterate over each item.</li>
        <li>Commenting out code makes them inactive without deleting them.</li>
        <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. In order for it to execute you must call the function.</li>
